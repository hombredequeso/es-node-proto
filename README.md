# Elasticsearch Nodejs Prototypes

Playing around with Elasticsearch through nodejs

## Usage

[Install Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) locally (v.5 or greater), running on the default port (http://localhost:9200)

```shell
npm install
```

Most of the .js files are intended to be run as standalone. For example:

```shell
node --use_strict info
node --use_strict .\bulk-populate.js
```

Queries to paste into kibana are in kibana.queries.sh
